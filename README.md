# Automating T-Rex

Automated T-Rex Game in Google Chrome by using Python programming by using modules 
* pyautogui and image processing Opencv module cv. 
* PyAutoGUI lets the Python program control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with the game.


## Usage

* Use the Coordinate.py file which uses the image processing module cv to detect the coordinates of the obstacles in front of the Dinosaur. 
* Mark a range of x and y coordinates for cactus and the bird.
* Use these coordinates as range in the for loop for finding the obstacles in the main.py file.
